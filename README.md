# These are my dotfiles

# Required software
- stow
- gomplate *(or any other Go template capable software)*

*Note: if Go templates are overkill, I'll switch to envsubst, the gomplate binary is 78MB, a bit heavy for configuring dotfiles, nice software though*

# Target OS / distro
Designed for Linux (tested on Arch). Likely works on other distros and FreeBSD with minimal tweaks.

**TL;DR:** Do whatever you want with it — even sell it and become the world’s first trillionaire.  
I literally don’t care — well, maybe buy me a beer if it happens.  
Also I’m not responsible for anything. If your machine catches fire after installing this, it's on you. JK I'm sure it won't.
